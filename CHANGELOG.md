# Changelog

Notable changes to this fork. Entries land here when work leaves
[TODO.md](TODO.md): under a version heading if the behaviour is visible to anyone
using the adapter, under **Maintenance** if it only matters to whoever works on
it next.

This fork of [hicder/agy-acp](https://github.com/hicder/agy-acp) cut its first
versioned delivery as `0.2.0`; everything under that heading shipped together.

## Unreleased

### Maintenance

- A newer push to a PR cancels its older e2e run, even one still waiting on approval. (PR #27)
- e2e failed turns try every roster model 15s apart, then sweep the roster again after 60s. (PR #27)
- e2e turns stop retrying after 25 min. (PR #27)
- e2e tests start on the last model that answered in the run. (PR #27)
- e2e roster includes every Flash-Lite slug agy lists alongside flash-low. (PR #27)
- e2e per-turn deadline rises from 120s to 330s, above agy's print-mode timeout. (PR #27)
- e2e job timeout rises from 20 to 100 min. (PR #27)
- `e2e-sweep` workflow cancels e2e runs waiting on approval after 3 days or once their PR closes. (PR #27)

## 0.3.0

### Changed

- Crate and binary renamed `agy-acp` → `agy-gated-acp` to match the
  repository. Sessions migrate automatically: a pre-rename
  `~/.openab/agy-acp/sessions.json` moves to the new state directory once on
  startup when nothing is there yet. The longer runtime prefix is offset by a
  shorter random token, so the socket-path budget is unchanged. Point hosts at
  the new binary name and restart them. (PR #26)

### Maintenance

- Repository renamed `agy-acp` → `agy-gated-acp` to mark the fork distinct
  from upstream. Remote guard, contributor references, and docs moved with it.
  (PR #25)
- README gains a Paseo usage section; the fork notice now records the upstream
  chain and points assessment detail at AGENTS.md instead of TODO.md. (PR #26)

## 0.2.0

### Added

- **Safe-command classifier** (`src/permission/safe_command.rs`): a
  character-allowlist tokenizer that recognises single invocations of 16
  read-only programs (`ls`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `file`, `stat`, `pwd`,
  `du`, `df`, `date`, `which`, `basename`, `dirname`, `grep`, `rg`), extracts
  path arguments, and enables one-and-done permission approval — "Always allow
  `ls` commands this session" instead of reprompting on every new path. A
  classified command with extra fields, shell metacharacters, or chained
  operations falls back to exact-string keying. Denies always narrow (fingerprint
  key), even when the allow side widened; the honor site checks two conjuncts
  (workspace containment and Cwd-relative path containment). (PR #21)

- `--permission-prompts` routes agy's tool permission checks to the ACP host.
  agy runs headless under this adapter and cannot ask, so without the bridge it
  auto-denies and tool calls fail silently. The bridge is the sole gate: agy runs
  with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` because its own checks would otherwise
  deny before a `PreToolUse` hook decision could take effect, so every case the
  bridge cannot resolve denies.
- Streaming reads `agy --output-format stream-json` instead of polling agy's
  SQLite conversation DB, adopted from upstream. Live updates arrive as agy
  writes them, and the conversation id comes from the stream rather than from
  diffing DB filenames.

### Changed

- The bridge socket and hook root live in a per-process random `0700` runtime
  directory with no predictable pathname; normal exit and handled signals remove
  only that owned directory, and `SIGKILL` remnants are inert and never swept by
  prefix.
- `schedule` and `invoke_subagent` are now a decided classification rather than a
  deferred one, settled by capturing agy 1.1.25/1.1.26. Both stay `"other"`
  (argument-keyed, always prompt): a subagent's tool calls reach the same
  `PreToolUse` hook under their own conversationId, and `schedule` runs its work
  in-turn, so neither may inherit an answer keyed by tool name alone. Two newly
  observed path fields, `ImagePaths` (`generate_image`) and `Subagents[].Workspace`
  (`invoke_subagent`), are added to `PATH_FIELDS` so containment checks them; a
  missed path field fails silently, so this closes real coverage. The permission
  prompt for a `schedule` call now says it may hold the turn open. See
  plans/completed/unclassified-tool-decision.md and dev-docs/agy-tool-surface.md.

- The auto-allow groups and tool classification name only tools agy has actually
  been observed to emit. `view_code_item`, `codebase_search`, `edit_file`,
  `propose_code` and `command_status` were upstream vocabulary this fork
  inherited: absent from agy's self-reported list and never seen in a captured
  payload, including on prompts written to draw them out. Keeping them was not
  free. `tool_kind` is not only a display label — `sticky_scope` asks
  `KEYED_BY_TOOL_KINDS` whether a kind may be remembered by tool name alone, and
  `"read"`, `"edit"` and `"search"` may — so classifying a tool nobody has seen
  promised its arguments were constrained by the path checks on no evidence that
  they were, and one "Always allow" would have covered every later call to it.
  Unknown tools now fall through to `"other"`, which is keyed by arguments and
  always prompts. `AGY_ACP_AUTO_ALLOW=reads` covers `view_file` and `list_dir`;
  `searches` covers `grep_search` and `find_by_name`.

  agy's seven self-reported but unobserved tools — `manage_task`, `send_message`,
  `schedule`, `invoke_subagent`, `define_subagent`, `manage_subagents`,
  `generate_image` — still reach `"other"` and still always prompt. The behaviour
  is unchanged, and the classification is now recorded and tested rather than
  reached by omission. Whether `"other"` is the *right* answer for `schedule`,
  which defers work past the turn its permission was scoped to, and for
  `invoke_subagent`, whose spawned agent may never route its tool calls back
  through this bridge, is deliberately still open.

- Permission prompt options say what they cover: "Always allow run_command this
  session" rather than "Always allow". The answer applies to every later call to
  that tool for the rest of the session, and the prompt -- which shows one
  command -- is where someone decides. The ACP `kind` values are unchanged, so
  hosts style and bind them as before.

### Fixed

- Hook IPC frames are bounded to one at-most-1-MiB JSON frame per connection on
  both sides, and malformed, oversized, slow, or semantically empty frames deny
  without asking the host.
- At most eight hook connections wait on the host at once; a further peer gets
  one bounded busy-deny rather than another long-lived task.
- The configurable host wait is capped at 589 seconds, preserving its order
  beneath the hook's 590-second response deadline.
- Safe-command approvals fall back to an exact key if classification loses coherence. (PR #21)

- `stat -t` no longer lets GNU's following filesystem operand bypass containment
  after a program-wide approval. (PR #21)

- `AGY_ACP_AUTO_ALLOW=none` no longer discards `AGY_ACP_SENSITIVE_PATTERNS`. The
  `none` arm returned a default policy, dropping the user's patterns, and that
  list is not only an auto-allow filter: `escapes_containment` re-checks it
  before honouring a sticky "Always allow". So the most restrictive auto-allow
  setting was the one that let an "Always allow" granted for one command cover a
  path the user had marked sensitive and never saw. The built-in patterns always
  applied; only user-supplied ones were lost.

- A turn that failed to spawn `agy` left the permission bridge bound to it. The
  binding is cleared on that path now, so the generation bump that stops a
  decision landing in the gap from matching a finished turn actually happens —
  without it a stray "always" could survive into the next turn.

- One "Always allow" on a command tool no longer approves every later command.
  Remembered answers were keyed by `(session, tool name)`, so approving
  `echo verification-one` silently approved a later `rm -f other.txt` — reproduced
  live under Paseo on 2026-08-30, with the file deleted and no second prompt. The
  key now carries a fingerprint of the arguments as well, and the narrow key is
  the default: a tool has to *earn* tool-level keying by being a read, edit or
  search tool whose arguments name nothing but paths, which is exactly the case
  where the containment and sensitive-path checks still constrain a remembered
  allow. An unknown tool gets the stronger key, and so does any call carrying a
  command line or a URL — `read_url_content` is classified as a read, but a `Url`
  is not a path field, so keying it by tool would have let one "Always allow" on
  a trusted URL cover every later one. Comparison is exact — no
  tokenizing, no shell semantics — because under-matching costs a prompt while
  over-matching is a hole; only agy's own presentational fields (`toolAction`,
  `toolSummary`, `WaitMsBeforeAsync`) are excluded, since they do not change what
  runs. Remembered **rejects** narrow identically, so rejecting one command
  forever rejects that command rather than the tool. The prompt labels say which
  is which, and say it in the right vocabulary: **Always allow this exact command
  this session** where the call carries a command line, **Always allow this exact
  call this session** where it is keyed by its arguments but is not a command
  (`read_url_content`, `search_web`, anything unrecognised), and **Always allow
  \<tool\> this session** where the answer really does cover the tool. The label,
  the stored key and the reason string are all derived from one `AlwaysScope`
  computed in `decide`, because they were previously computed in three places
  with nothing tying them together.

- A session's remembered answers are now forgotten when the session is evicted.
  `BridgeState.always` and `BridgeState.conversations` accumulated for the life of
  the process and nothing ever removed an entry, so a session id recycled after
  eviction inherited answers it was never given. `evict_if_needed` is synchronous
  and cannot await the bridge's lock, so it queues the victim id and the
  dispatcher drains the queue between requests; re-admitting the same id before
  the drain cancels the pending forget. It drops both maps: the remembered
  answers, and the agy-conversation-to-session binding, so a hook still arriving
  for a forgotten conversation is resolved by the running session instead. Every
  path this opens still ends at a prompt or a denial -- forgetting can only
  remove an answer, never add one -- so the worst case is being asked again. This also bounds the bridge by the
  same 64 sessions as the map, and gives "this session" a defensible meaning: the
  answer lasts as long as the session is live in memory.

- A turn no longer leaves its permission request behind when it ends. An
  outstanding `session/request_permission` was keyed only by its JSON-RPC id, so
  nothing could find it again: the call sat waiting for its full 540-second
  timeout, and that timeout marks a refusal, landing in whatever turn happened to
  be running nine minutes later and reporting `stopReason: "refusal"` for a turn
  nobody refused. Pending requests now carry the session that asked, and both
  cancellation and ordinary turn teardown answer their own — denying, because agy
  must not run the tool, but not as a refusal, since nobody declined anything.
  Clearing it at teardown as well as on cancel matters: a turn that ends because
  agy died or its output became unreadable left the same request behind, with the
  same consequence, and nothing else would ever have cleared it. A late answer
  from the host is dropped rather than applied, so an "always allow" arriving
  afterwards cannot become sticky for the rest of the session. Starting a turn
  clears everything still pending as well, in the same place the refusal flag is
  reset — one turn runs at a time across the whole adapter, so a leftover there
  can only belong to a turn that is over, and routing it through the one point
  every turn must pass keeps a dropped teardown call from being enough to bring
  the bug back. It clears every session's, not just the starting session's:
  the refusal flag is one flag for the adapter rather than one per session, so a
  request stranded by one session times out into whichever turn is running nine
  minutes later, which is somebody else's. The host may still be showing the
  prompt: ACP has no way to retract a request, and a host that cancels is
  expected to dismiss its own.

  Applying a decision is gated on the turn that asked for it, which closes the
  same leak by its other route. The host's answer resolves the request, but the
  hook task that acts on that answer runs whenever the runtime next polls it —
  possibly after the turn ended, by which point the pending entry is long gone
  and draining it cannot help. A refusal applied then set the adapter-wide flag
  after the turn that asked had already read it, so the *next* turn reported
  `stopReason: "refusal"` having asked nobody anything, and an "always" applied
  then became a standing permission for the turns that followed. Both are now
  dropped unless the turn that asked is still the turn that is running — where
  "running" excludes the gap between one turn's teardown and the next turn's
  start, since `always` is not reset by anything and a sticky answer applied in
  that gap would outlive it.

  Nothing is decided on behalf of a turn that is not the one running. A hook task
  is not polled on any schedule of the adapter's: it can first reach the decision
  path after its own turn tore down, or after the next turn started. Left alone it
  would raise a prompt for a turn that no longer exists — and, worse, adopt the
  running turn's identity, so answering it counted against a turn that never asked.
  Such a request is now denied without asking anyone, and registering the question
  revalidates that rather than trusting the check: the two are separate lock
  acquisitions with work in between, so the turn can end in the gap, and teardown's
  drain would run before the entry exists to be drained.

- Cancelling a turn stops the command, not just agy. `session/cancel` killed the
  `agy` process alone, and agy runs a tool call by shelling out, so the shell and
  its command were reparented to PID 1 and ran to completion — verified against
  agy 1.1.22 by cancelling `sleep 45 && touch marker` and watching the marker
  appear 45 seconds later, and by the same route a build, a `curl` or an `rm -rf`
  would have finished too. A cancel now kills agy's whole process tree: agy is
  stopped so it cannot start anything else, the process table is read while agy
  is still alive to hold the parent links, whatever is found is stopped too and
  the table read again until a read turns up nothing new — stopping agy does not
  stop the shell it already started, and that shell can fork its next command
  between two reads — and then the lot is killed, agy last. Killing agy's *process group* would have been the obvious
  fix and does not work: agy puts each command it runs into a process group of
  its own, so `killpg` on agy reaches agy and nothing else. agy is still spawned
  into its own group, but only so that a signal aimed at the adapter's group
  cannot kill agy first — which would erase the parent links the walk needs. The
  adapter also kills those trees on `SIGTERM`, `SIGINT` and `SIGHUP`; previously
  there was no kill on exit at all, no signal handler and no `Drop`, so
  terminating the adapter orphaned the whole tree silently. On a non-Unix target there is no process table to
  walk, so a cancel kills the direct child as it always did, and there is no
  shutdown kill at all.

- Judge `find_by_name`'s `SearchDirectory`, and `FilePath`, as paths.
  `SearchDirectory` was missing from `PATH_FIELDS`, so a relative value — with no
  leading `/`, no `~` and no `..` — was judged by neither the field-name test nor
  the shape tests, and a search directory that left the workspace through a
  symlink would not have been prompted. Found by capturing real agy traffic.
  `FilePath` was added on separate evidence: `tools.rs` and `protobuf.rs` already
  treated it as naming a location while `PATH_FIELDS` did not.

- Two paths reached around the permission boundary. `outside_workspace()` only
  looked at arguments beginning with `/`, so `../../secret` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
  were never judged against the workspace and were auto-allowed; relative and
  home-relative arguments are now resolved from each root and normalized
  lexically, so `sub/../file.txt` is judged inside and `../secret` outside. And a
  remembered "Always allow" was consulted before any containment or
  sensitive-path check, so one approval of `view_file` opened `.env` for the rest
  of the session; a sticky allow now falls through to asking when the call leaves
  the workspace or names something sensitive. A sticky reject still applies
  immediately.
- Containment had two more holes of the same kind. With no workspace root
  registered the check looked only at absolute arguments, so `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
  counted as contained; an unset root now contains nothing. And traversal was
  detected by searching for the two characters `..`, so an ordinary query like
  `foo..bar` was read as a path leaving the workspace; it must now be a path
  component.
- A plain relative argument was never judged a path. Containment looked at a
  value's shape -- a leading `/` or `~`, or a `..` component -- so that a search
  query would not be mistaken for a file, which left `link/secret.txt` escaping
  through an in-workspace symlink without being checked at all. agy's arguments
  are a fixed schema, so the known path fields (`AbsolutePath`, `TargetFile`,
  `DirectoryPath`, `SearchPath`, `Cwd`, `Paths`) are now judged whatever their
  value looks like, and `Query` is still left alone. A field missing from that
  list keeps the shape tests and nothing else, so an omission costs coverage
  rather than raising a false prompt.
- A symlink out of the workspace was contained. `is_inside()` accepted a path
  either as written or resolved, and the as-written form matched on its first
  component: `<workspace>/link/../secret` looked inside even where `link` points
  out of the workspace and the kernel follows it there. Only the resolved form
  counts now, falling back to lexical normalization for a file that does not
  exist yet -- which at least cancels the `..` that `starts_with` ignores.
- A failed drain could still hang the turn. When a stdout read error was
  followed by a fallback `tokio::io::copy` that also failed, nothing was reading
  agy's stdout and `child.wait()` waited on a child blocked writing to a full
  pipe -- the exact hang the byte-framed read was added to prevent. An
  undrainable pipe now kills the child, and is reported as a failed turn rather
  than a cancelled one.
- Persisted sessions were pruned on a whole-second timestamp, so entries written
  within the same second tied and were evicted in `HashMap` order, which could
  drop a just-refreshed resumable session and keep an older one. `updated_at` is
  milliseconds.
- A prompt carrying no `sessionId` could not be cancelled at all: its token was
  deliberately left out of the registry, while the turn itself ran a full agy
  process. It is now registered under the id it was given -- the empty one -- so
  a cancel naming that id reaches it.
- A remembered "Always reject" deadlocked the bridge. The branch holding it took
  the state mutex in an `if let` scrutinee, whose guard lives to the end of the
  body, and the body awaited the same mutex. It had no test until now, so it went
  unnoticed since the feature landed.
- A single malformed byte on agy's stdout hung the turn. The drain loop ended on
  the first read error -- and invalid UTF-8 is a read error -- after which nothing
  read the pipe, so the child blocked writing and `child.wait()` never returned.
  Frames are read as bytes and decoded lossily, and a genuine I/O error drains
  the remainder before giving up.
- `session/update` notifications could corrupt a response. The stream reader held
  its own `io::stdout()` handle while the main loop wrote the same fd, so two
  writers could interleave mid-line. Every notification now goes through the
  main loop's output channel, as the permission bridge already did.
- Cancelling a turn could cancel the wrong one. The cancellation map held one
  token per session, so a second prompt for that session overwrote the first's
  token and a cancel flipped the wrong flag; whichever turn finished first
  removed the other's token entirely. Tokens are now per turn, removed by
  identity, and a cancel stops every turn in the session.
- `sessions.json` grew without bound -- 910 entries on one machine, 553 never
  bound to a conversation -- and every turn rewrote the whole file. It is capped
  at 256 entries, dropping unresumable ones first and oldest first within each
  group. In-memory eviction also picked an arbitrary `HashMap` key, so it could
  drop a live session and keep a dead one; it is now least-recently-used.
- Model selection sent agy a model name it rejects. `agy models` prints
  `id<TAB>Human Label`; the whole line was being used as the id, so `--model`
  received `gemini-3.7-flash-high\tGemini 3.7 Flash (High)`. ACP now gets the id
  as `modelId` and the label as `name`, ids from a client are checked against
  what agy offers, and a tab-joined value left in an old `sessions.json` is
  repaired on restore. Upstream splits the tab but keeps the label
  (`parse_model_line`, `hicder/agy-acp` at 858041c, `src/adapter.rs:702-706`),
  which is the same defect from the other end.
- A failed turn could report success. The error response was gated on no updates
  having been emitted, so a turn that streamed one chunk and then failed returned
  `stopReason: "end_turn"`. A stream reaching EOF without its terminal `result`
  event was also treated as completion.
- A tool call the user refused is reported as `stopReason: "refusal"` rather than
  a provider error. agy reports a refusal as a failed turn, and only the bridge
  knows the difference; its own fail-closed denials deliberately do not count.
- `session/load` replays conversation history again. Upstream's stream-json
  rewrite dropped it along with the SQLite reader, leaving a reopened thread with
  an empty transcript while agy still had the context. SQLite is read for this
  path and nothing else.
- The protobuf walkers could panic on a corrupted or hostile conversation DB. A
  length field of `u64::MAX` wrapped `i + len`, turning the bounds check into a
  pass and panicking on the slice. All offset arithmetic is checked.
- The README's Zed example recommends `--permission-prompts`. The instruction it
  replaces -- that you **must** set `AGY_EXTRA_ARGS="--dangerously-skip-permissions"`
  -- came in with upstream's README in this same change and never described this
  fork, which has had the bridge all along. The bypass is still documented, as an
  opt-in with a warning.

### Maintenance

- Reorganized the TODO board into linked plans and preserved research notes. (PR #23)

- E2e transient turn failures now fail over through the model roster before two
  retries, after 30s then 60s. (PR #21)

- Split the permission hook client, prompt wording, and command-sticky tests
  into focused modules to keep the CI file-length gate green. (PR #21)

- The e2e workflow now asks for environment approval once, not twice. It had two
  jobs referencing the `e2e` environment -- a `gate` job that read the secret to
  check presence, then the test job -- and GitHub prompts for each protected-
  environment job separately. Collapsed to one job: the fork-skip is the job
  `if` (it needs only the event, no secret), and the secret-presence check is the
  first step, with the real steps guarded on its output so a missing key still
  reads as a green no-op rather than a failure.

- e2e tests now run serially (`--test-threads=1`). Each drives a real agy turn
  against the Gemini API, and running the four in parallel burst against the
  free-tier key's low per-minute Flash quota, intermittently aborting one turn
  with "Agent execution terminated due to error". Serial keeps the calls under
  the rate limit.

- The e2e environment is now proven, not just configured. A run went through the
  full chain -- gate job, reviewer approval, pinned-archive verification, and all
  four e2e tests -- and passed on a same-repository PR. That closes the standing
  "configured but unproven" gap, since a mistake anywhere in that chain would have
  read as *skipping*, indistinguishable from the missing-secret case it replaced.

- README now describes the permission boundary as it actually is. Two
  corrections. The bridge is the sole gate on the model's **tool calls**, but not
  on a workspace's own `.agents/hooks.json` lifecycle-hook commands (`PreInvocation`,
  `Stop`), which `agy` runs directly, outside the bridge -- so opening an untrusted
  repository can run its hook commands unprompted; the README said "the only gate
  on tool execution" without that carve-out. And the `"other"` classification is
  now stated as the deliberate contract for the open-ended part of agy's tool
  surface: any tool the fork does not recognise (an MCP `mcp_<server>_<tool>`, a
  subagent-driven call, anything new) is argument-keyed and in no auto-allow
  group, so it cannot be auto-allowed and prompts unless an exact-argument
  "Always allow" for that identical call is already remembered. Both close their
  TODO entries; see
  plans/workspace-hook-trust-boundary.md and dev-docs/agy-tool-surface.md.

- The e2e workflow could not run agy. Three things, all surfaced on the gate's
  first real runs (it had been "configured but unproven"). (1) The install step
  looked for a binary named `agy`, but the release `linux_x64` archive ships it
  as `antigravity`, so `find` matched nothing and the step died on a silent
  `test -n`; the find now accepts either name. (2) Every real turn aborted with
  "Agent execution terminated due to error". The cause was the model, not the
  agy version: with no model selected the adapter passes no `--model`, so agy
  used its default Gemini Pro model, which a free-tier `GEMINI_API_KEY` cannot
  call. Reproduced locally against the CI config with the real key, both the
  failure (default model) and the fix (any Gemini Flash tier succeeds). The
  `settings.json` `model` field is keyed by display label, not slug, so the
  configure step now selects the newest `*-flash-low` label from the live
  `agy models` list and writes it -- self-updating, so a catalog rename (3.5 was
  already dropped, 3.8 is now default) needs no manual bump; it falls back to
  `"Gemini 3.6 Flash (Low)"` if the query returns nothing. (3) Incidentally the
  pin was
  bumped `1.1.16` -> `1.1.26` (sha updated); this was not the turn-execution fix
  but keeps CI on the version used locally. A local preflight that used the
  installer-provided `agy` rather than extracting the raw archive, and that ran
  under OAuth rather than a free API key, would have masked both the name
  mismatch and the model failure, which is how they reached CI.

- `permission.rs` was sitting at exactly the 1200-line cap, so the next line
  added to it -- a doc comment, in this case -- failed the length gate. The
  cluster that decides how broad a remembered "Always" answer may be
  (`sticky_scope`, `KEYED_BY_TOOL_KINDS`, `args_fingerprint`, `tool_kind` and
  the two reach checks) moved to `permission/sticky_rules.rs`, alongside the
  existing `path_rules.rs`. Behaviour is unchanged; the grouping is the point,
  since getting the breadth wrong is how one "Always allow" covers a call the
  user never saw.

- The tree is rustfmt-formatted and CI enforces it with `cargo fmt --check`.
  Formatting drift only ratchets — 9 hunks when CI was set up, 27 after the
  test-module split — because every file was written by hand, and `AGENTS.md`
  had to tell each contributor and agent not to run bare `cargo fmt`. That rule
  is gone. The pre-push hook checks formatting too, so the gate is reachable
  before a push rather than only after one, and `rustfmt.toml` names the style
  edition so the gate's answer does not move when the floating `stable`
  toolchain does. The formatting commit is listed in
  `.git-blame-ignore-revs`; run
  `git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs` once to keep blame
  readable locally, as GitHub already does.

- E2e model rotation is confirmed, not experimental. The configure step writes
  the fallback `settings.json` first — `agy models` prints nothing without it
  under a bare key — then collects the flash-low slugs into `E2E_MODEL_ROSTER`
  for the tests to spread turns across via `session/set_model`. Probes measured
  1 request per no-tool turn, base-model metering (effort variants share one
  bucket), and no project-wide aggregate: ~20 runs/day across the three live
  base versions. `scripts/e2e-local.sh` runs the tier locally under a throwaway
  HOME from a `.env.e2e.local` token. See
  plans/completed/e2e-quota-rotation.md. (PR #19)

- E2e turns retry once after a 60s sleep. Per-minute 429s carry a ~37s
  retryDelay, so the transient class usually clears on the second attempt;
  daily-quota 429s fail again just as fast, with a hint pointing at the agy log.
  (PR #19)

- The two files and one function that had outgrown reading are split.
  `handle_session_prompt` is four phases instead of 317 lines, path containment
  moved out of `permission.rs` into `permission/path_rules.rs`, and the flat
  2879-line `tests.rs` became per-subject test files beside the modules they
  exercise. The turn lifecycle has tests for the first time, driven by stub
  binaries rather than a real `agy`. Complexity lints are denied crate-wide and
  file length is capped by `scripts/check-file-length.sh`
  ([plans/completed/split-large-files.md](plans/completed/split-large-files.md)).
- `pr_compliance_checklist.yaml` gains a rule for what a cancel has to reach, so
  an automated review that sees `child.kill()` reappear on a kill path, or the
  walk swapped back for `killpg`, has the measurement to judge it by.
- Check `PATH_FIELDS` against real agy 1.1.22 traffic. One field was missing (see
  Fixed above); every other path argument observed is covered, and `Url`, `query`
  and the boolean `FullPath` are correctly not treated as paths. Also established
  agy's tool surface as observed in 1.1.22, which does not match this fork's
  assumptions: five tool names in `permission.rs` match nothing agy emitted or
  self-reported, and seven tools it does report are unclassified here. Both
  recorded in [TODO.md](TODO.md).
- Keep the Windows build portable by failing closed when the Unix-socket-based
  `--permission-prompts` feature is requested there.
- Keep fork PRs from waiting on an e2e-environment approval they cannot use, and
  make unit-test scratch homes collision-resistant across test processes.

- CI (`ci.yml`, PR #10): `cargo build`, unit tests, ignored I/O tier
  (`--ignored --skip e2e`), clippy (`-W clippy::all -D clippy::all`;
  `handle_session_prompt` complexity lints at `#[warn]` until refactor), and
  `cargo llvm-cov` coverage (artifact + job summary; no threshold). Rust 1.70 on
  Linux and Windows. SHA-pinned Actions; e2e is approval-gated with
  `E2E_GEMINI_API_KEY`. No formatting gate.
- Pre-push hook (PR #10): clippy + unit tier after canonical fork-guard URL
  check; `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`; `SKIP_LOCAL_GATES=1` skips
  clippy/tests only.
- `handle_session_prompt` cognitive-complexity baseline 39/25;
  `WalkedToolFields` tuple struct fixes `clippy::type_complexity` in
  `protobuf.rs` (PR #10).
- Plans live in `plans/`, `plans/completed/`, and `plans/deferred/`; CHANGELOG
  style and semver deferral documented in `AGENTS.md`.
- Hard fork: the `upstream` remote is removed, `gh repo set-default` points at
  this fork, and `.githooks/pre-push` refuses any target but `kgrizz-git/agy-acp`
  after `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. Note that `gh pr create` in a fork
  defaults its base to the parent repo regardless of git remotes, which is what
  that second guard is for.
- `scripts/check-upstream.sh` and a weekly workflow report commits on
  `hicder/agy-acp` that this fork has not taken, comparing against
  `.upstream-watermark`. The watermark moves only in a commit a human made.
- `pr_compliance_checklist.yaml` describes this fork's invariants for automated
  review, after two review findings cited rules describing the architecture the
  stream-json port replaced.
- Fork notes folded from `AGENTS.fork.md` into `AGENTS.md`; work items moved to
  `TODO.md`.
- `AGENTS.md` claimed `cargo test` does no filesystem I/O and that the `#[ignore]`d
  tier is what touches disk. Neither has been true for a while: tier-1 permission
  and persistence tests create scratch directories under `$TMPDIR`, and the
  ignored set is ignored by inheritance. The compliance checklist's record of
  known permission gaps is likewise updated, since one of the two it listed is
  closed by this branch.
- Removed the stale test-only conversation-DB delta reader. Load-replay coverage
  now proves that its persisted all-row watermark advances past a trailing user
  message.
